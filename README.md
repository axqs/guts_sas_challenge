# sas_grocery_list: Dragonfruit

A flutter phone app created to track and remind you when your food goes off, to reduce food waste!

First, add items to your digital grocery list. As you pick items up at the shop, select the item on your list and add it to the fridge using the "Add to Fridge" button, which places the item in your fridge list and simultaneously removes it from your shopping list. We have average expiry times stored in a file for some foods, but alternatively, if the item you bought is not one stored in our file you can manually enter the expiration date when you add the item to your list. 

To see the items you picked up, navigate to your Fridge List by using the drawer menu on the top left of the page, where each item has either a green, yellow, or red dot to let you know whether your items are good, nearly expired, or expired. 

The app then gives notifications when the food in your Fridge List is expected to expire based on the average expiry dates in our file for each item and when you moved it from your Shopping List to the Fridge list at the grocery store. 

The notifications will give you a chance to use the food before it is out of date, reducing food waste. At this point, you will be given a link to recipes you can make to make use of that ingredient before it goes off.
